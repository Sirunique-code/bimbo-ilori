                    <p>
                        I was a bright and outspoken child—always eager to read, write, and express my thoughts. My
                        parents nurtured me with love, education, and good values. That foundation mattered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From childhood, I gravitated toward storytelling and communication. I loved crafting words,
                        engaging in presentations, and standing confidently before audiences. I was never the shy one!
                        (Laughs.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This natural inclination followed me into my adolescent years, where I thrived in forums,
                        discussions, and lead roles.

                    <h2 class="fw-bold">A Path of Structure and Strategy</h2>
                    <p>
                        I studied BSc Accounting and later secured a position with the Federal Ministry of Education,
                        where I was deployed to the classroom. But I was never just a teacher, I was a builder, a
                        systems thinker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While my colleagues focused on lesson plans, I was drawn to policies, records, and
                        documentation. I started organizing files for the school clubs under my oversight, creating
                        structured frameworks that improved efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My passion for administration extended beyond the classroom into groups and fellowships I was
                        part of, earning me leadership roles wherever I went.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Realizing my knack for systems and leadership, I pursued a Master’s in Business Administration
                        and eventually ventured into entrepreneurship—founding multiple businesses, including:

                    <h2 class="fw-bold">The Awakening: From Organization to Life Transformation</h2>
                    <p>
                        As I built structures for organizations, I started encountering individuals who sought my help,
                        not just for administrative support but for personal clarity, organization of thoughts, and
                        direction in life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People came to me feeling stuck, confused, and uncertain. They didn’t just need systems; they
                        needed clarity of purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without realizing it at first, I was mentoring, guiding, and coaching, helping individuals break
                        free from confusion and step into alignment with their unique paths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the demand for my insights grew, I knew this work wasn’t just a passion, it was a calling. I
                        had to move beyond informal guidance to a structured, impactful approach that could reach more
                        lives.

                    <p>
                        Alongside coaching and mentorship, my love for writing never waned. I constantly wrote
                        organizational policies, letters of encouragement, personal reflections, and inspirations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time, these writings became the foundation of my published works, leading to over 38 book
                        titles to date, under the generic term LPPD Books (Life Purpose and Personal Development). These
                        books have been transformational for many.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With my growing conviction in purpose-led living, I formalized my expertise by earning:
